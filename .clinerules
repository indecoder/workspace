# Cline Rules - E-commerce Frontend Project

## Core Principles
*   **Modern Angular:** Prioritize the use of modern Angular features, specifically:
    *   Angular Signals for state management where appropriate.
    *   Deferred Views (`@defer`) for optimizing the loading of non-critical UI sections.
    *   Lazy Loading for feature modules via the Angular Router.
*   **Angular Material:** Utilize Angular Material components for UI consistency and rapid development. Adhere to Material Design principles.
*   **SCSS:** Use SCSS for styling, following Angular CLI conventions.
*   **Modularity:** Structure the application into logical feature modules.

## Development Workflow
*   Follow standard Angular CLI workflows for generating components, services, etc. (`ng generate ...`).
*   Keep Memory Bank files (`memory-bank/`) updated, especially `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`, after significant changes or task completion.
